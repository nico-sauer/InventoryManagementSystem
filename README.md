# Inventory Management System

## Project Description

This project is to have a simple inventory management system for a store.
The system allows you to add products, remove products, update quantities, retrieve product information, and calculate the total value of the inventory.
It involves classes to represent products and an inventory manager to handle product operations. 

## Running the application

- main.py can simply be executed without dependancies. This is the console version with additional reporting features.
- mainGUI.py is a GUI version, but needs `pip install -r requirements.txt` to be executed first, so that the needed **flet** dependancies are installed.
    - Be sure to first activate your virtual environment before you do this.
